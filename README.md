Code related to quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of various adaptations in two hybrid crosses of cichlids. One cross was between Labidochromis caeruleus and Labeotropheus trewavasae, and a second cross was between Aulonocara koningsi and Metriaclima mbenjii. Scripts include those used to call genotypes, generate the linkage map, and analyze data related to melanic barring in the Aulonocara and Metriaclima cross.
